Spirit Quest Android Game Version: Lollipop - Marshmellow 
Used some free assets from Run Like Hell assets just sprites and background
everything else was made by us (animation by us/ lighting too)

Reasoning for assets
1. Were not artists (as much as we would like to be)
2. Oh were not artists did I not mention that /:
-----Scenes/Transitions
Main Menu
	Three buttons will be displayed
		Play Game (need to click button)
		Settings (need to click settings button)
		High Score (need to click high score button)

Game
	Gameplay:
		If character kills enough enemies then enemies will get
		stronger. This is a game mechanic so game won't be 
		repetitive.
	Game will start character should be able to move
		Player Movement:
			1. Move left and right (using buttons)
			2. Up (pressing up button)
			3. Attack (pressing attack button)
	As of right now we gave the character a broken hit box.
	Also as of right now the enemies are a little bit to strong.

Gameover
	Screen will display a skull laughing at the user while offering 
	three options
	1. Go back to the game and play (clicking retry)
	2. Go to high scores (clicking/ tapping highs scores)
	3. Go back to the main menu (pressing quit)

High Scores
	Will display the top 3 scores some scores might be loaded
	2 Options will be displayed.
	1. Reset High scores
	2. Quit which goes back to main menu

Settings
	Since its an android only implemented mute button since its
	redundant to have a scroller right???!
	2
	1. [Toggle button] for sound
	2. back button to return to the main menu
